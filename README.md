# Loan Default Prediction
## Problem Definition
## The Context:
In the contemporary landscape of retail banking, a significant proportion of profits stems from interest accrued through home loans, primarily extended to customers with regular or high income. However, the specter of loan defaulters poses a considerable threat to banks, as non-performing assets (NPAs) can substantially erode profits. Therefore, the approval process for these loans is a multifaceted challenge, traditionally relying on manual assessments of applicants' creditworthiness. Yet, this approach is not only labor-intensive but also susceptible to human errors and biases.

Recognizing the limitations of heuristic-based automation attempts, many banks are turning to the power of data science and machine learning to revolutionize the loan approval process. The goal is to develop machine learning models capable of learning the intricacies of the approval process, eliminating biases, and enhancing efficiency. However, a crucial consideration in this endeavor is to ensure that the machine does not inherit biases ingrained in the historical human approval process.

## The objective:
The primary objective is to build a classification model capable of predicting clients likely to default on their loans. Additionally, the model should provide actionable recommendations to the bank regarding crucial features to consider during the loan approval process.
